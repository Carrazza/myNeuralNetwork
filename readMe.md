# simple neural networks

I made these networks based on :

  - this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
  - that is based on this [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

Basically it implements from scratch a deep neural network using stochastic gradient descent and quadratic cost function and later uses L2 regularization along with cross entropy cost function.

It has lots of comments explaining what is what, but it's very similar to the original source code, I only changed some names to adapt source code to my learning experience.

On `numbers/`, you can see some examples analyzed by the NN
